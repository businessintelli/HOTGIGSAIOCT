## AI Features Deep Dive

### AI Job Matching Engine

**Algorithm Design:**
The matching engine uses a sophisticated weighted scoring system that evaluates four key dimensions of candidate-job fit. Skills matching accounts for forty percent of the total score, evaluating exact matches, related skills, and partial matches. Experience level matching contributes thirty percent, comparing candidate experience against job requirements while handling both overqualification and underqualification scenarios. Location compatibility represents fifteen percent of the score, with special handling for remote jobs and hybrid flexibility. Education requirements make up the final fifteen percent, matching degree levels and fields of study.

**Scoring Methodology:**
- Skills (40%): Exact match (full points), Related skills (partial points), Preferred skills bonus (up to 20 points)
- Experience (30%): Level matching with penalties for significant mismatches
- Location (15%): Remote always matches, Hybrid flexible, On-site requires location match
- Education (15%): Degree level and field matching

**Output:**
- Overall match score (0-100)
- Match quality label (Excellent 90+, Great 80-89, Good 70-79, Fair 60-69, Low <60)
- Detailed breakdown by category
- Personalized recommendations for improvement

### Resume AI Analyzer

**Analysis Components:**
The analyzer evaluates resumes across three major categories totaling one hundred points. ATS compatibility scoring (40 points) checks for essential sections including contact information, experience, education, and skills, while also evaluating action verb usage, quantifiable achievements, and proper formatting. Structure analysis (30 points) assesses section completeness and organization, identifying any missing components. Content quality (30 points) examines action verb density, achievement quantification, buzzword usage, and result-oriented language.

**Recommendations Generated:**
- Missing section alerts with specific guidance
- Keyword suggestions for target roles
- Formatting improvement tips
- Content enhancement recommendations
- Buzzword reduction advice
- ATS optimization strategies

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- 90-100: Excellent - ATS-ready
- 80-89: Good - Minor improvements needed
- 70-79: Fair - Several improvements recommended
- 60-69: Needs Work - Significant improvements required
- Below 60: Poor - Major revisions needed

### AI Job Description Generator

**Generation Process:**
The generator leverages OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini model to create professional, engaging job descriptions. The system accepts comprehensive inputs including job title, primary and secondary skills, experience level, location, work model, employment type, salary range, company description, and additional requirements. The AI then generates a compelling job description with multiple sections including an engaging overview, six to eight key responsibilities, required qualifications, preferred qualifications, and benefits and perks.

**Features:**
- Professional, engaging copy that attracts candidates
- ATS-optimized with proper keyword density
- Structured format with clear sections
- Customizable based on company culture and requirements
