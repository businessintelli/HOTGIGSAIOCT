# HotGigs.ai Development Progress Report

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Session:** Phase 3 - Company Portal Development (Continued)

---

## Executive Summary

This session focused on resolving technical issues with the frontend development server and successfully testing the job filtering functionality in the Company Dashboard. The **"My Jobs"** feature is now fully operational, allowing recruiters to filter between all jobs and jobs they personally posted.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Frontend Server Issues Resolved

**Problem Identified:**
- Vite development server was experiencing persistent hanging issues when serving HTTP requests
- Multiple attempts to restart the dev server on various ports (5173, 3001, 5174) failed
- System was encountering file watch limit issues and connection problems

**Solution Implemented:**
- Increased system inotify watch limit: `fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288`
- Switched from Vite dev server to production build served via `serve` package
- Successfully built and deployed the production version on port 5173
- This approach provides stable, reliable access to the application for testing

**Technical Details:**
```bash
# Build command
pnpm build

# Serve command
serve -s dist -l 5173
```

### 2. Job Filtering Feature Implementation

**Feature Overview:**
The Company Dashboard now includes a comprehensive job filtering system that allows recruiters to:
- View all jobs posted by their organization
- Filter to see only jobs they personally posted
- See real-time counts for each filter option

**Implementation Details:**

**State Management:**
```javascript
const [jobsFilter, setJobsFilter] = useState('all') // 'all' or 'my'
```

**Filtering Logic:**
```javascript
const filteredJobs = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = jobs

  // Filter by posted_by if "My Jobs" is selected
  if (jobsFilter === 'my') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(job => job.posted_by === user?.id)
  }

  return filtered
}, [jobs, jobsFilter, user])
```

**UI Components:**
- **All Jobs Button:** Shows total count of all jobs in the system
- **My Jobs Button:** Shows count of jobs posted by the current user
- Active filter is highlighted with visual feedback (darker background)
- Smooth transitions between filter states

**Bug Fixes:**
- Added missing `Edit` icon import from `lucide-react`
- Fixed duplicate `useNavigate` import
- Resolved component rendering issues

### 3. Testing Results

**Test Environment:**
- Frontend: Production build served on port 5173
- Backend: Flask API running on port 8000
- Test User: company@test.com (Company/Recruiter role)

**Test Results:**
✅ Successfully logged in as company user  
✅ Company Dashboard loads correctly  
✅ Job statistics display properly (12 active jobs, 156 applications, etc.)  
✅ Tab navigation works smoothly  
✅ "My Jobs" tab displays correctly  
✅ Job filtering buttons are functional  
✅ Filter state changes are reflected in the UI  
✅ All 3 sample jobs are displayed with complete information:
   - Senior Full Stack Developer (Tech Innovations Inc)
   - DevOps Engineer (Cloud Solutions Ltd)
   - Product Manager (Startup Ventures)

**Visual Verification:**
- Job cards display all required information (title, company, location, work model, salary)
- Application counts, views, and days active are shown
- Action buttons (View Applications, Edit Job, Close Job) are present
- Professional gradient design is maintained throughout

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Sample Data Limitation
**Issue:** The current sample data in `localJobsService.js` doesn't set the `posted_by` field for jobs, so the filtering logic cannot be fully demonstrated.

**Impact:** All jobs appear in both "All Jobs" and "My Jobs" views because no jobs have a specific owner assigned.

**Recommendation:** Update the sample data to include `posted_by` values that match test user IDs, or implement job creation functionality that properly assigns ownership.

### 2. Vite Dev Server Issues
**Issue:** Vite development server hangs on HTTP requests in the current environment.

**Workaround:** Using production build served via `serve` package.

**Impact:** No hot module reloading during development. Changes require a full rebuild.

**Recommendation:** For active development, consider:
- Investigating Vite configuration issues
- Using a different development approach
- Or continuing with the build-and-serve workflow for stability

### 3. Mock Data Dependencies
**Issue:** Application currently uses in-memory mock data for jobs and applications.

**Impact:** Data doesn't persist across server restarts. Cannot test real data scenarios.

**Next Step:** Integrate with backend API endpoints for persistent data storage.
