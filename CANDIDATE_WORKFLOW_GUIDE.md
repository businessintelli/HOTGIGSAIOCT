## 🤖 AI Matching System Explained

### How AI Matching Works in the Dashboard

The AI matching system is the core intelligence behind HotGigs.ai, providing personalized job recommendations with precise match scores.

### **Architecture Overview**

```
Candidate Profile → AI Matching Engine → Job Database → Match Scores → Dashboard Display
```

### **Matching Algorithm Components**

#### **1. Skills Matching (40% Weight)**
The system analyzes candidate skills against job requirements:

**Exact Match (100 points):**
- Candidate has the exact skill listed in job requirements
- Example: Job requires "Python" → Candidate has "Python"

**Related Match (75 points):**
- Candidate has a related or similar skill
- Example: Job requires "React" → Candidate has "Vue.js"

**Partial Match (50 points):**
- Candidate has foundational knowledge
- Example: Job requires "Machine Learning" → Candidate has "Data Analysis"

**Calculation:**
```python
skills_score = (exact_matches * 100 + related_matches * 75 + partial_matches * 50) / total_required_skills
```

#### **2. Experience Level Matching (30% Weight)**

**Experience Levels:**
- Entry Level (0-2 years)
- Mid Level (3-5 years)
- Senior Level (6-10 years)
- Lead/Principal (10+ years)

**Scoring:**
- **Exact match:** 100 points
- **One level difference:** 75 points
- **Two+ levels difference:** 50 points

#### **3. Location Matching (15% Weight)**

**Work Model Compatibility:**
- **Remote jobs:** Match with any location (100 points)
- **Hybrid:** Match if within 50 miles (80 points)
- **On-site:** Match if same city/region (100 points)

**Distance Calculation:**
```python
if work_model == "remote":
    location_score = 100
elif work_model == "hybrid":
    location_score = 100 - (distance_miles / 50) * 20
else:  # on-site
    location_score = 100 if same_city else 50
```

#### **4. Education Matching (15% Weight)**

**Education Levels:**
- High School
- Associate's Degree
- Bachelor's Degree
- Master's Degree
- PhD

**Scoring:**
- **Meets or exceeds requirement:** 100 points
- **One level below:** 75 points
- **Two+ levels below:** 50 points

### **Final Match Score Calculation**

```python
final_score = (
    skills_score * 0.40 +
    experience_score * 0.30 +
    location_score * 0.15 +
    education_score * 0.15
)
```

### **Match Quality Labels**

- **95-100%:** 🎯 Excellent Match (Green)
- **85-94%:** ✅ Great Match (Light Green)
- **75-84%:** 👍 Good Match (Yellow)
- **65-74%:** 🤔 Fair Match (Orange)
- **Below 65%:** ❌ Low Match (Red)

### **Dashboard Display**

**What Candidates See:**
1. **Match Percentage:** "97% Match" badge on job cards
2. **Color Coding:** Green for excellent, yellow for good, etc.
3. **Ranking:** Jobs sorted by match score (highest first)
4. **Recommendations:** Top 3-5 jobs on dashboard

**Behind the Scenes:**
- AI engine runs every time dashboard loads
- Scores recalculated when profile updates
- Real-time matching for new jobs
- Personalized for each candidate

├── "Browse Files" Button
├── Supported Formats: PDF, DOCX, DOC
├── Max File Size: 5MB
└── Current Resume: [filename.pdf] (if exists)
```

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/candidates/profile/{email}/resume`

**Request:**
- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **File Field:** `resume`

**Process:**
1. File uploaded to server
2. Stored in `/uploads/resumes/{user_id}/`
3. Filename: `{user_id}_{timestamp}.pdf`
4. Database updated with file path

### **Step 2: AI Resume Analysis**

**Automatic Analysis Triggered:**
Once uploaded, the Resume AI analyzer processes the file.

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/ai/analyze-resume`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "resume_text": "Extracted text from PDF...",
  "target_job_title": "Senior Software Engineer"
}
```

**Analysis Components:**

#### **1. ATS Compatibility Score (0-100)**

**Checks:**
- ✅ Standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- ✅ Readable fonts and formatting
- ✅ No images or graphics (ATS can't read them)
- ✅ Proper date formatting
- ✅ Contact information at top
- ✅ No tables or columns (can confuse ATS)

**Scoring:**
```python
ats_score = (
    section_completeness * 0.30 +
    formatting_quality * 0.25 +
    keyword_density * 0.25 +
    structure_quality * 0.20
)
```

#### **2. Content Quality Analysis**

**Checks:**
- Action verbs usage (Led, Developed, Managed, etc.)
- Quantifiable achievements (numbers, percentages)
- Relevant keywords for target role
- Appropriate length (1-2 pages)
- Grammar and spelling

**Scoring:**
```python
content_score = (
    action_verbs_count / total_bullets * 0.30 +
    quantified_achievements / total_bullets * 0.30 +
    keyword_matches / required_keywords * 0.25 +
    length_appropriateness * 0.15
)
```

#### **3. Keyword Optimization**

**Extracts:**
- Technical skills mentioned
- Industry-specific terms
- Soft skills
- Certifications
- Tools and technologies

**Compares Against:**
- Target job description
- Industry standards
- Common ATS keywords

**Recommendations:**
```
Missing Keywords:
- Add "Kubernetes" (found in 85% of similar jobs)
- Add "Agile/Scrum" (found in 70% of similar jobs)
- Add "CI/CD" (found in 65% of similar jobs)
```
